/**
 * Deciding what Chaatak will answer.
 *
 * Chaatak is a weather assistant, not a general assistant — but the boundary
 * is generous and UNSURE RESOLVES TO IN SCOPE. Turning away a farmer's real
 * question is a worse failure than answering a slightly off-topic one, and
 * "क्या आज घर से निकलूँ?" is a weather question wearing casual clothes.
 *
 * Three outcomes:
 *   inScope false               → one friendly redirecting line
 *   inScope, needsWeather true  → fetch, ground, answer
 *   inScope, needsWeather false → converse; no fetch, no citation
